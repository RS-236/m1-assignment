                <h2>Why adoption over buying</h2>
                <p>Pet adoption is quickly becoming the preferred way to find a new dog or cat, and rightly so, there are many benefits to adopting a pet. Pet adoption fees are usually much lower than buying from a breeder.</p>
                <p>You are also likely to find a pet who has already learned a few things. Adoptable pets are often already housetrained, good with kids, and do well with other pets. And do not forget the wonderful feeling you get from saving a life!</p>
                <h2>How to find the perfect pet</h2>
                <p>Do you know what type of pet personality you're looking for? Finding the ideal pet for your home should start with understanding the pet personality that best fits your lifestyle, not necessarily a specific breed. Consider this, do you need a dog that is low key? Perhaps a cat that gets along well with others?</p>
